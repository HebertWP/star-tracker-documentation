                   and material The Second Edition of this fundamental textbook maintains
                   the book's tradition of clear, thought-provoking instruction. Readers
                   are provided once again with an instructive mix of mathematics, physics,
                   statistics, and information theory. All the essential topics in information
                   theory are covered in detail, including entropy, data compression,
                   channel capacity, rate distortion, network information theory, and
                   hypothesis testing. The authors provide readers with a solid understanding
                   of the underlying theory and applications. Problem sets and a telegraphic
                   summary at the end of each chapter further assist readers. The historical
                   notes that follow each chapter recap the main points. The Second
                   Edition features: Chapters reorganized to improve teaching 200 new
                   problems New material on source coding, portfolio theory, and feedback
                   capacity Updated references Now current and enhanced, the Second
                   Edition of Elements of Information Theory remains the ideal textbook
                   for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical
                   engineering, statistics, and telecommunications. An Instructor's

  abstract  = {This thesis researches different star pattern recognition and attitude determination algorithms for a three-axis rotational spacecraft.  A simulated star field will be suspended above the experimental Three-Axis Spacecraft simulator to proved a reference for the star-pattern recognition algorithms.  A star field inertial reference frame database of stars will be developed with the simulator at zero attitude.  The angle, planar triangle and spherical triangle star patter recongition algorithms will then be used to identify which stars are within a camera's field of vision.  The imaged stars will then be matched up to the corresponding stars within the test bed database.  With the imaged stars identified and the corresponding inertial frame reference data, the test bed's attitude will be determined using the least-squares, TRIAD, and Quaternion Estimator (QUEST) attitude determination algorithms.  On the three-axis simulator, an iterative algorithm is developed to demonstrate increasing star tracker accuracy with each update A matrix.}

The five methods considered are the standard Hough Transform, the Fast Hough Transform of Li et al.1, a two stage Hough method, and two space saving approaches based on the method devised by Gerig and Klein2. The performance of each of the methods has been compared on synthetic imagery and real images from a metallurgical application. Figures and comments are presented concerning the accuracy, reliability, computational efficiency and storage requirements of each of the methods.}
